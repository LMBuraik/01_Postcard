My name is Labibah Buraik. I was born in Saudi Arabia and raised in Pakistan and Afghanistan. I came to the US at the age of 10 and have spent the majority of my life in Minnesota. I am a mother of 4, a Licensed Graduate Social Worker, Psychotherapist, and a first year PhD student at the University of Minnesota. I enjoy reading fiction, dancing with my husband, and exploring the local state parks with my children
